            <p class="para">These terms and conditions, as may be amended from time to time, apply to all our services directly or indirectly (through distributors) made available online, through any mobile device, by email or by telephone. By accessing, browsing and using our (mobile) website or any of our applications through whatever platform (hereafter collectively referred to as the "Platform") and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the privacy statement).</p>
            <h2 id="tcs_s0" class="bui-f-font-heading"> Definitions </h2><br>
            <p class="para">"Booking.com", "us", "we" or "our" means Booking.com B.V., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and having its registered address at Herengracht 597, 1017 CE, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
                "Platform" means the (mobile) website and app on which the Trip Service is made available owned, controlled, managed, maintained and/or hosted by Booking.com.
                "Trip" means the various different travel products and services that can be ordered, acquired, purchased, bought, paid, rented, provided, reserved, combined or consummated by you from the Trip Provider.</p><br>
            <p></p>
            <h2 id="tcs_s1" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 1. Scope and nature of our Service </h2> <br>
            <p class="para">Through the Platform, we (Booking.com B.V. and its affiliate (distribution) partners) provide an online platform through which Trip Providers – in their professional conduct of business (i.e. B2C or B2B) – can advertise, market, sell, promote and/or offer (as applicable) their products and service for order, purchase, reservation, rent or hire, and through which relevant visitors of the Platform can discover, search, compare, and make an order, reservation, purchase or payment (i.e. the Trip Service). By using or utilizing the Trip Service (e.g. by making a Trip Reservation through the Trip Service), you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the Trip Provider with which you make a reservation or purchase a product or service (as applicable). From the point at which you make your Trip Reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the Trip Provider, transmitting the relevant details of your Trip Reservation to the relevant Trip Provider(s) and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the Trip Provider. Booking.com does not (re)sell, rent out, offer any (travel) product or service.</p>
            <h2 id="tcs_s2" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 2. Prices, crossed-out rates and We Price Match </h2> <br>
            <p class="para">The prices as offered by the Trip Providers on our Platform are highly competitive. All prices for your Trip are displayed including VAT/sales tax and all other taxes (subject to change of such taxes) and fees, unless stated differently on our Platform or the confirmation email/ticket. Ticket prices are per person or group and subject to validity or expiration as indicated on the ticket, if applicable. Applicable fees and taxes (including tourist/city tax) may be charged by the Trip Provider in the event of a no-show or cancellation.</p><br>

            <h2 id="tcs_s3" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 3. Privacy and cookies </h2><br> 
            <p class="para">Booking.com respects your privacy. Please have a look at our privacy and cookies policy for further information.</p>
            <h2 id="tcs_s4" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 4. Free of charge for consumers, only Trip Providers pay! </h2><br> 
            <p  class="para">Unless indicated otherwise, our service is free of charge for consumers because, unlike many other parties, we will not charge you for our Trip Service or add any additional (reservation) fees to the rate. You will pay the Trip Provider the relevant amount as indicated in the Trip Reservation (plus - insofar not included in the price – relevant applicable taxes, levies and fees (if applicable)).</p><br>
            <p class="para">Trip Providers pay a commission (being a small percentage of the product price (e.g. room price)) to Booking.com after the end user has consummated the service or product of the Trip Provider (e.g. after the guest has stayed at (and paid) the accommodation). Trip Providers can improve their ranking by increasing their commission (Visibility Booster). The use of the Visibility Booster (by increasing the commission in return for better position in the ranking) is at each Trip Provider's discretion and may be used from time to time and product to product offered. The algorithm of the ranking will take an increase in commission into account when determining the Default Ranking. Preferred partners pay a higher commission in return for a better position in the ranking.</p>
            <p class="para">Only Trip Providers which have a commercial relationship with Booking.com (through an agreement) will be made available on Platform (for their B2B and/or B2C promotion of their product). Booking.com is not an open platform (like Amazon or eBay) where end users can make their product available (no C2C platform); Booking.com does not allow non-professional parties to offer or sell their products on or through Booking.com.</p><br>
            <h2 id="tcs_s5" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 5. Credit card or bank transfer </h2><br>
            <p class="para">If applicable and available, certain Trip Providers offer the opportunity for Trip Reservations to be paid (wholly or partly and as required under the payment policy of the Trip Provider) to the Trip Provider during the Trip Reservation process by means of secure online payment (all to the extent offered and supported by your bank). For certain products and services, Booking.com facilitates (through third party payment processors) the payment of the relevant product or service (i.e. the payment facilitation service) for and on behalf of the Trip Provider (Booking.com never acts nor operates as the merchant of record). Payment is safely processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the accommodation provider through a third party payment processor. Any payment facilitated by us for and on behalf of, and transferred to the Trip Provider will in each case constitute a payment of (part of) the booking price by you of the relevant product or service in final settlement (bevrijdende betaling) of such (partial) due and payable price and you cannot reclaim such paid monies.</p><br>

            <h2 id="tcs_s6" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 6. Pre-payment, cancellation, no-show and fine print </h2><br>
            <p class="para">By making a Trip Reservation with a Trip Provider, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that Trip Provider, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Trip Provider that may apply to your Trip (including the fine print of the Trip Provider made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the Trip Provider), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Trip Provider. The relevant (delivery/purchase/use/carrier) terms and conditions of a Trip Provider can be obtained with the relevant Trip Provider. The general cancellation and no-show policy of each Trip Provider is made available on our Platform on the Trip Provider information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable). Please note that certain rates, fees or special offers are not eligible for cancellation, refund or change. Applicable city/tourist tax may still be charged by the Trip Provider in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation. Please check the (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Please note that a Trip Reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be cancelled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant due or payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the Trip Provider and the reservation. Cancellation and prepayment policies may vary per segment, product or service of each Trip.. </p><br>
            <h2 id="tcs_s7" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 7. (Further) correspondence and communication </h2><br> 
            <p class="para">By completing a Trip Reservation, you agree to receive (i) an email which we may send you shortly prior to your arrival date, giving you information on your destination and providing you with certain information and offers (including third party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in for this information) relevant to your Trip (Reservation) and destination, (ii) an email after arrival to rate the (experience with your) Trip Provider and the Trip Service, and (iii) an email which we may send to you promptly after your stay inviting you to complete our guest review form. See our privacy and cookies policy for more information about how we may contact you.</p><br>

            <h2 id="tcs_s8" class="bui-f-font-heading"> 8. Ranking, preferred programme, stars and guest reviews </h2><br> 
            <p class="para" >The default setting of the ranking of Suppliers on our Platform is 'Booking.com Recommends' (or any similar wording); this is the Default Ranking. Please note that the Default Ranking is created through a complex ever changing and evolving system (algorithm) that considers a multitude of criteria in order to match searchers and accommodations in an optimal way.  The actual ranking will be different for each customer and for each search as there are many criteria included, for example the popularity of an accommodation premises among our visitors (e.g. guest reviews), customer service history (including the number and type of guest complaints), certain booking-related data (e.g. number of bookings, cancellations, conversion rate, overbookings, availability, etc.) and the (past) browsing activities of a visitor. On-time payment of commission by an accommodation and the commission percentage are also included in the algorithm of the Default Ranking. Please note that for convenience we also offer other ways to rank Suppliers. A customer can choose to rank for example an accommodation on the basis of lowest price first, review scores, accommodation type (etc.). A customer thus has full control on the presentation of the search results.</p><br>
